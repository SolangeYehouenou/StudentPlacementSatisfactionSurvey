# StudentPlacementSurvey
This assignment asks you to reflect on various concepts, paradigms and architectures related to Software Development. Based on your code you have to do a video to discuss the four themes object orientation, event-driven programming, interoperability, and virtual identity. You will develop code in a main-stream programming language chosen by you. Your main submission is the video; but you will also submit supporting evidence that shows that you worked on the code. Example code will be demonstrated during the practical sessions and provided on BREO using Java and Eclipse; there will also be some discussion of JavaScript and PHP. In your code you must use at least one web service from an external provider. Examples will be discussed in the lectures. This is an individual assignment.
